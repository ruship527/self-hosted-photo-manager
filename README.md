# Self-Hosted Photo & File Management App

A self-hosted web application for uploading, organizing, previewing, downloading, and managing photos and files.  
The project was built with a FastAPI backend and a simple browser-based frontend, then deployed on an Ubuntu homelab server using Docker.

## Overview

This project was created as a personal self-hosted alternative to basic cloud photo and file storage. It allows users to upload photos and documents, view them through a web interface, organize photos into albums, and use AI-generated tags to help identify uploaded images.

The project also served as hands-on experience with backend development, Linux server deployment, Docker containers, file storage, database design, and debugging real deployment issues.

## Features

- Upload photos and general files through a web interface
- Preview uploaded photos in a gallery layout
- Preview supported files from the browser
- Download uploaded photos and files
- Delete uploaded photos and files
- Organize photos into albums
- Store metadata such as:
  - Original filename
  - Saved filename
  - Upload date
  - Photo taken date
  - File hash
  - AI-generated tags
- Detect duplicate uploads using file hashing
- Generate AI tags for uploaded images
- Backend database storage using SQLAlchemy
- Docker-based deployment
- Designed to run on a self-hosted Ubuntu server
